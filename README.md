# Web developer tech assessment

This is a Rails/Javascript technical challenge to prompt discussion about problem solving and more importantly, knowledge of the two main languages of the King & McGaw tech stack. The task is relatively simple and should be completed in no more than 4 hours. The description is kept purposely vague because we feel it reflects a typical task that is presented to a developer.

## Create an app that allows visitors to ask a question and others to respond to those questions
  - it must be a Rails app with some part of the functionality that uses javascript to enhance the user-experience
  - minimum of one test using minitest or rspec
  - css/styling is not a necessary part of this assessment, but it should use correct html markup
  - the app should run without errors

  - this is meant to see how the candidate approaches problem solving in an artificially short time frame
  - we will use this app to discuss the thought process and trade-offs that had to be made
