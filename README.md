# Web developer tech assessment
This is a Rails/Javascript technical challenge to prompt discussion about problem solving and more importantly, knowledge of the two main languages of the King & McGaw tech stack. The task is relatively simple and should be completed in no more than 4 hours. The description is kept purposely vague because we feel it reflects a typical task that is presented to a developer.

## The task:
Create an app that allows visitors to ask a question and others to respond to those questions. That's it! Simple

## Requirements:
  - it **must be a Rails app** with a small part of the functionality **using javascript** to enhance the user-experience. ie. a simple modal, form validation or even animation.
    - The flavour of JS is not important. If jQuery is your strong suit, use that. If it's Stimulus, React, Vue or plain JS/Typescript that's also fine.
  - At least one spec using framework of your choice
  - css/styling is not a necessary part of this assessment, but valid html should be used
  - This is meant to see how the candidate approaches problem solving in an artificially short time frame
  - We will use this app to discuss the thought process and trade-offs that had to be made
  - Instructions on how to set up and use the app should be found in the README
